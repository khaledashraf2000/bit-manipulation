# Bit manipulation functions

Bit manipulation is the process of manipulating binary bits of numbers using AND (&), OR (|), and XOR (^) gates, right shifting (>>), and left shifting (<<), to achieve a specific task such as counting number of ones in a binary number, checking if i-th position is set (1) in a binary number.. etc.
Bit manipulation is widely used in embedded systems, networking, and areas of graphics.

This repository is my solutions to some bit-wise problems using bit manipulation in C.
